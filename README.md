## B-Team Photography Website
by Joey Buczek: Owner, Photographer

Built with Ruby 2.1.2, Rails 4.1.9, Foundation 4.5.4

**Users/Clients**

There are currently two user roles: admin & client. In order for a user to become a client, they must currently be an actual client of B-Team Photography. The user's account is initiated by the admin, and the login information is emailed to them. There is a temporary password for the user to login for the first time with, upon which they are prompted to change it (unless they elect to keep it). 

Client users are able to see and edit both personal and event photography information, along with having access to any web gallery links hosted by the site. They are also able to see and pay down their remaining balance for the photography services through the B-Team site.

There is one admin user, which is able to create, edit, and delete clients through the site's interface. Additionally, all new 'events' to be photographed for the clients will be added by the admin user through the site as well.
