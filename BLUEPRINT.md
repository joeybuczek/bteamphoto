## User stories to help develop the site.

1: As the admin user, I'd like to create, delete, and manage user accounts. 

 - I should be able to edit their contact information, add a wedding photography event, and edit the details of that event. All users should be listed in a Client Index view.

2: As a user, I'd like to receive an invitation to use the site to manage my wedding photography event details. 

 - I should receive an email with login information, including an initial, temporary password that I can change after I log in. When I log into the site, I should be directed to a "My Details" page that contains all my contact and wedding photography event details, along with the option to edit those details and view my current balance.

3: As a user, I'd like to make secure credit card payments towards my balance. 

 - I should be able to access this feature through the "My Details" page.
