## User stories to help develop the site.

**1: As the admin user, I'd like to create, delete, and manage user accounts (wedding photography clients).**

 - I should be able to edit their contact information, add a wedding photography event, and edit the details of that event. All users should be listed in a Client Index view (which serves as the admin dashboard).

**2: As a user, I'd like to receive an invitation to use the site to manage my wedding photography event details.**

 - As a user I should receive an email with login information, including an initial, temporary password that I can change after I log in. When I log into the site, I should be directed to a "My Details" page that contains all my contact and wedding photography event details, along with the option to edit those details and view my current balance.
 
 - As the admin, I should be able to send an invitation from my Client Index dashboard page. I should also be able to see the status of the invitation (pending until client logs in for the first time).

**3: As the admin user, I'd like to create an invoice for a wedding photography event.**

 - I should be able to attach an invoice to a wedding instance that includes a description, balance, and due date. Also, each invoice should have the option of an itemized breakdown, including a tax rate for the client's county.
 
**4: As a user, I'd like to view the invoice for my wedding photography event.**

 - I should be able to view the invoice balance due along with any itemized listing on the invoice. I should have access to this through my wedding details page.

**5: As a user, I'd like to make secure credit card payments towards my balance (via Stripe).**

 - I should be able to access this feature through the "My Details" page.
