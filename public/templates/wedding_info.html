	Your wedding day will stay with you forever. From walking down the aisle, to the first kiss as a married couple, and then swaying in each other's arms to that song you've been waiting to hear all night. You'll always remember your big day, so you need to ensure that you'll be able to keep those memories as vivid as though it had just happened. That's where we come in.

	We're not just wedding photographers, we're also married ourselves, so we know how special this day is for you. We've gone through all the steps you're going through now, and then some; from the engagement, to the ceremony, and then into the years afterwards. We cherish every memory. Our goal is to create your visual wedding story so that you, too, can relive it for years to come.

	Your wedding will be unique and personalized to you. We feel your photography should be as well. When we meet with you we'll go over all the exciting details together and create a customized package just for you. This ensures that your specific needs will be met instead of trying to work around something that's pre-determined. After all, this day is all about you!
